# HandTracking-Module

In this project we will learn Hand Tracking in real-time. We will first write the bare minimum code to run, then learn how to convert it into a module so we don’t have to write it again and again for different projects. The best part is we don’t have to configure a 100 parameters along with 20 installs to make it run. Within 10 to 15 mins you will have your model working.

This Code Has 3 files
--
1. HandTrackingMin.py->This is contains the full fledge code which I wrote using python lang and by using modules like opencv and mediapipe
2. HandTrackingModule.py-> This file contains the code with OOPS Concepts to make it a module and can be further used in any python project which need hand tracking
3. testHandTrackModule.py-> This is just a testing code file to see our module is running correctly or not
